Update — Changes, rationale and local testing

Date: 2025-10-19

Overview
--------
This update adds server-side persistence and fixes to the student sign-in flow so the project meets the stated goal:

- Digital Attendance Register: HTML form for sign-in, JavaScript that highlights late arrivals in red, and PHP + MySQL saving attendance logs.

What I changed
--------------
1. student-dashboard.html
   - Added two inputs to the sign-in form: `firstName` and `lastName` (before the student number input).
   - Purpose: Collects student first/last names which the JS and server endpoint expect.

2. student-dashboard.js
   - Fixed validation bugs and made `signInAttendance()` an async function.
   - Now reads `firstName`, `lastName`, `studentNumber`, and requires them before signing in.
   - Attempts to POST attendance to `save_attendance.php` using Fetch + FormData.
   - On server success: uses the returned record and updates the attendance history in the UI.
   - On server failure or network error: falls back to a local in-memory record (so sign-ins still work offline temporarily).
   - Styling: `.status-badge.late` set to a red theme so late arrivals are clearly visible.

3. db_connect.php
   - Removed a debug `echo "Connected successfully";` so API endpoints can return clean JSON responses.

4. save_attendance.php (NEW)
   - Accepts POST fields: `studentNumber`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `sessionId`, `classId`, `classCode`, and optional `status`.
   - Inserts a record into a table `attendance_logs` using a prepared statement.
   - Returns JSON on success/failure. Example success response:
     { "success": true, "message": "Attendance saved", "record": { ... } }

Why these changes
------------------
- The project previously stored some session info in the lecturer's browser memory, and the student-side JS expected first/last name but the HTML form didn't include them. That caused broken validation and prevented saving useful student details.
- There was no server endpoint to persist attendance logs in a database. Adding `save_attendance.php` provides persistent storage.
- The debug echo in `db_connect.php` made JSON responses invalid when included in API replies.

Database changes
----------------
Create the database/tables if they do not already exist. Example SQL (run in phpMyAdmin or MySQL CLI using the same DB name set in `db_connect.php` — by default the repo used `Attendance_db`):

Update — Changes, rationale and local testing

Date: 2025-10-19

Overview
--------
This document records the recent updates that make the project meet the core requirement: a HTML student sign-in, client-side UX styling, JavaScript late detection and UX, and server-side PHP + MySQL persistence of attendance logs.

Quick highlights (what's new)
- Added server endpoint: `save_attendance.php` to persist attendance into `attendance_logs`.
- Fixed and hardened student sign-in JS: async flow, server POST (fetch/await), validation, and fallback local recording.
- Added `firstName` and `lastName` inputs to the student sign-in form.
- Removed debug output from `db_connect.php` so JSON API responses are clean.
- Improved late-entry styling: `.status-badge.late` now uses a red theme for clear visibility.

Detailed changes
----------------
1. `student-dashboard.html`
   - Added `firstName` and `lastName` text inputs above the student number field so the form provides the name fields required by the client and server logic.

2. `student-dashboard.js` (multiple fixes)
   - Made `signInAttendance()` async and fixed earlier validation bugs where first/last name checks were commented out.
   - Builds a `FormData` payload (studentNumber, firstName, lastName, sessionId, classId, classCode) and POSTs it to `save_attendance.php` using fetch + await.
   - If the server responds with success, the returned record is used to update the attendance history in the UI.
   - If the server request fails (network/DB error) the code falls back to creating a local in-memory record so sign-in doesn't block offline.
   - Removed a duplicate variable/definition bug and ensured the async fetch is awaited correctly.
   - UI: added/updated `.status-badge.late` to a red palette for clear late highlighting.

3. `db_connect.php`
   - Removed the `echo "Connected successfully";` debug statement so API endpoints can return pure JSON without stray output.

4. `save_attendance.php` (NEW)
   - JSON endpoint that accepts POSTed attendance and inserts into `attendance_logs` via prepared statement.
   - Returns JSON success or error details so the client can respond immediately.

Why these changes
------------------
- The student form lacked name fields required by the JavaScript and server logic; adding them fixed validation and enables storing full student info.
- The sign-in flow previously relied on browser-memory session state and had JS bugs that prevented reliable operation. Making the sign-in async + server-backed improves reliability.
- The new server endpoint provides persistent storage of attendance logs; the DB table `attendance_logs` is the canonical log source.

Database schema (example)
-------------------------
Run these SQL statements in phpMyAdmin or MySQL CLI (DB name should match `db_connect.php`, default in repo is `Attendance_db`):

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Attendance_db;
USE Attendance_db;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS attendance_logs (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  class_id INT NOT NULL,
  class_code VARCHAR(100),
  student_number VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  first_name VARCHAR(100),
  last_name VARCHAR(100),
  status VARCHAR(20),
  timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Optional supporting tables (if not already present):
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
  role VARCHAR(20),
  email VARCHAR(255),
  password VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS modules (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  module_code VARCHAR(100),
  module_name VARCHAR(255),
  venue VARCHAR(255),
  start_time TIME,
  grace_period INT
);

How to test locally (Windows + XAMPP)
-------------------------------------
1. Start XAMPP and ensure Apache + MySQL are running.
2. Ensure project files are in `c:\xampp\htdocs\Digital-student-attendence-app`.
3. Create the DB and tables using phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin) or MySQL CLI with the SQL above.
4. Open the lecturer dashboard in your browser:
   http://localhost/Digital-student-attendence-app/lecturer-dashboard.html

5. Lecturer steps:
   - Use the "Add New Module" form to add a module and set a grace period.
   - Click "Generate QR Code" and copy/open the generated student URL from the QR modal (it should link to `student-dashboard.html?session=...&class=...&code=...`).

6. Student steps (on the student page with session query params):
   - The sign-in card will show a highlighted state.
   - Enter First Name, Last Name and Student Number, then click "Check in".
   - Open developer tools (Network tab) to watch the POST to `save_attendance.php`.
   - If successful, the client shows a success message and the returned record is appended to the attendance list.
   - Verify persistence: open phpMyAdmin and query `attendance_logs` to confirm the new row.

7. Offline / server-failure behavior:
   - If the server can't be reached the client falls back to a local in-memory record visible in the student history table. Note: these local records are not automatically synced to the DB.

Validation checklist (quick)
--------------------------
- Confirm `student-dashboard.html` contains First/Last/Student Number fields.
- Confirm `student-dashboard.js` makes a network POST to `save_attendance.php` (check Network tab).
- Confirm `save_attendance.php` returns JSON { success: true, record: { ... } } and a DB row appears in `attendance_logs`.
- Confirm late entries appear with red `.status-badge.late` styling.

Next recommended steps (short list)
----------------------------------
1. Server-side sessions & lateness calculation
   - Create a `sessions` table and change QR generation to create a session on the server. `save_attendance.php` should compute on-time vs late using server timestamps and stored `start_time` + `grace_period`.

2. Lecturer retrieval & reporting
   - Add `get_attendance.php` to fetch persisted attendance rows (filters by class/date) and update `lecturer-dashboard.js` to fetch server data instead of relying on in-memory arrays.
   - Add `attendance_summary.php` to generate CSV/summary reports for download.

3. Security hardening
   - Hash passwords (`password_hash()` / `password_verify()`).
   - Validate student numbers server-side before accepting attendance.

Files changed / added in this update
-----------------------------------
- Modified: `student-dashboard.html` (added name inputs)
- Modified: `student-dashboard.js` (async sign-in, fetch POST, fallback, UI fixes)
- Modified: `db_connect.php` (removed debug echo)
- Added: `save_attendance.php` (attendance persistence endpoint)
- Modified: `Update.md` (this file)

If you'd like, I can implement the server-side session table and server-calculated late detection next (this will make recorded attendance trusted and allow lecturers to fetch full persisted logs). Which of the recommended next steps would you like me to start on?
